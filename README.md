# Git Assistant

Git Assistant is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** tool designed to enhance your interaction with GitHub repositories through natural language queries. By combining state-of-the-art embeddings and contextual retrieval, Git Assistant enables seamless exploration and understanding of codebases.



## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions about a GitHub repositoryâ€™s structure, functionality, or design and receive precise, contextual answers.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Leverages embeddings and similarity-based search to provide relevant code snippets and explanations.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with repositories written in various programming languages.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Explains functions, classes, files, or general architectural patterns within a repository.



## How It Works

1. **Embedding Creation**:
   - Code files are tokenized and converted into vector embeddings for efficient similarity searches.
   - Pinecone serves as the vector database for storing embeddings.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User queries are matched against stored embeddings to retrieve relevant code snippets or files.
   - Responses are generated by the Llama 3.1 LLM, leveraging retrieved context for accurate explanations.

3. **User Interface**:
   - A chatbot-like interface allows intuitive interaction with the codebase.


## Prerequisites

Ensure the following before setting up the application:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Pinecone account for embedding storage
- API keys for:
  - Pinecone
  - Groq (or other LLMs)
  - Hugging Face
  - Supabase (for storing chat history)


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SreeSharvesh/Git-Assistant
   cd Git-Assistant
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: 
   Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:
   ```bash
   PINECONE_API_KEY=<your-pinecone-api-key>
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=<your-pinecone-environment>
   PINECONE_INDEX_HOST=<your-pinecone-index-host>
   GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<your-huggingface-api-key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application and access the chatbot interface.
2. Ask questions about a GitHub repository to retrieve insights on its structure or functionality.
3. Review detailed explanations and relevant code snippets.


## System Architecture
